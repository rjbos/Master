My name is RJ Bos and I am a life scout working towards Eagle.

My project is *Safety and Security* for Christine Critters.  It consists of three areas:
 - Installing a centrally monitored security system with mobile access
 - Installing a recorded camera system
 - Doubling the size of the current turkey pen
 
Here is a timeline of my Eagle project progress to date:
