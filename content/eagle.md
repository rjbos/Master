My name is RJ Bos and I am a life scout working towards Eagle.

My project is *Safety and Security* for Christine Critters.  It consists of two areas:
1. Installing a camera system with mobile access
2. Building a 10' x 10' mew (falcon cage)
 
I had a fund raiser for this project consisting of a Trini Dinner, which was held on March 17th, 2018, at Norfield Parish Hall at 64 Norfield Road, Weston CT.

I was aiming for **60** people and almost made that goal.   Thanks to many donations by those who couldn't come, I was able to exceed by fundraising target.  All the proceeds have been handed over to Christine's Critters.

Here was the menu of the fundraiser:

## Appetizer
* Yellow split-peas and spinach fritters.
* Doubles - traditional snack of two bara with curried channa
* All served with Mango Chutney, Cucumber Chutney and Trini hot sauce.

## Dinner
* Turmeric spiced Chickpeas
* Curried Chicken
* Pork Ribs Trini style (Cumin-flavored)
* Aloo Roti (Potato-stuffed) and Partaha Roti (Buss up shut)
* Basmati rice
* Lentil stew

## Desert
* Gulab Jamoon
* Sweet rice
* Ginger Tea

## Entertainment
* Trini Music: Soca, Calypso, Chutney, Parang
* Birds of prey flight demonstration by Christine of Christine's Critters
