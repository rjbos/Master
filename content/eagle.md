My name is RJ Bos and I am a life scout working towards Eagle.

My project is *Safety and Security* for Christine Critters.  It consists of three areas:
 - Installing a centrally monitored security system with mobile access
 - Installing a recorded camera system
 - Doubling the size of the current turkey pen
 
I am going to fund this project with the proceeds from a Trini Dinner to be held on March 17th at Norfield Parish Hall at 64 Norfield Road, Weston CT.

If you would like to attend this dinner, please register using this Survey Monkey link.
