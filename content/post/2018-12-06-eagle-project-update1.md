# Project Update

Christine's Critters was able to release four of their six turkey's into the wild, so they don't need a bigger turkey pen anymore.  What they do need is an additional mew, which is a cage for a hunting falcon.  So that is a modification to my eagle project.

The first step of the project was to clear the area and level the ground as best we could.  We found a lot of rocks and tree roots along the way.

We built a 2x4 frame to test out the ground as we dug because using 4x4s would prove too heavy to move.

Once the ground was level we laided down the 4x4s and fastened them together.

Mew regulations require all the windows to have bars instead of wire mesh so the birds won't damage their tail feathers.  Assembling the bars in the window proved to be more difficult than we thought it would.
