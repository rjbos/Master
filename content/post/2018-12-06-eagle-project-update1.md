# Project Update

Christine's Critters was able to release four of their six turkey's into the wild, so they don't need a bigger turkey pen anymore.  What they do need is an additional mew, which is a cage for a hunting falcon.  So that is a modification to my eagle project. Cristine's Critters would like to get this mew done as soon as possible, so I am starting my project right away.  Due to the late fall temperatures, we are doing as much prep work in our garage as possible, such as building wire mesh frames and building windows.  We can them take these frames to the site to install them.

There are specific regulations that must be followed when building a mew and mew's must be inspected and passed before they can be used.  Here is a highlight of the regulations:

* At least 10 feet by 10 feet in size
* At least 7 feet tall
* At least 50% of the walls and root must be covered in solid material
* The windows must have verticle bars on them

### Day 1: Clear and level the area (Saturday, December 1st)

The first step of the project was to clear the area and level the ground as best we could.  We found a lot of rocks and tree roots along the way.

We built a 2x4 frame to test out the ground as we dug because using 4x4s would prove too heavy to move.

### Day 3: Installing wire under the foundation

Once the ground was level we put down the 4x4s and fastened them together.

We put wire under the foundation 4x4s to keep animals out, even mice!  Gross fact: Mice will eat at the birds feet while they sleep (so I am told).

Mew regulations require all the windows to have bars instead of wire mesh so the birds won't damage their tail feathers.  Assembling the bars in the window proved to be more difficult than we thought it would.

### Day 3: Fill with pea gravel and frame walls (Saturday, December 8th)

We moved over 1 ton of gravel using buckets because it could not be delivered up the stairs.

After we got all the gravel up there, we were able to put up the walls.  Here is the end of day 3.

### Day 4: Install panels and siding and roof (Sunday, December 9th)

Day three went well.  We built the foundation for the vestibule, put the panels on the roof, and installed the siding and windows.  Here are some pictures:

The mew is pretty much done.  The solid door still needs to be built and the vestibule door still needs to be installed.

### Special Thanks

Thanks so much to Henry Hayden for coming out all four days and Lev Rubin for coming out one of the days.  These two scouts came out to help in below freezing temperatures to get this project done quickly as needed by Christine's Critters.  And a big thank you to Dave, a Christine's Critters volunteer, for lending his talents and tools to the project.
