My name is RJ Bos and I am a life scout working towards Eagle.

My project is *Safety and Security* for Christine Critters.  It consists of three areas:
* Installing a centrally monitored security system with mobile access
* Installing a recorded camera system
* Doubling the size of the current turkey pen
 
I am going to fund this project with the proceeds from a Trini Dinner to be held on March 17th at Norfield Parish Hall at 64 Norfield Road, Weston CT.

I am shooting for **60** people and so far I have about **25** signed up.  If you would like to attend this dinner, please register using this [Survey Monkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QK6FXJD) link.
