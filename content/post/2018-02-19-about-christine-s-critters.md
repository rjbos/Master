My Eagle project will benefit Christine's Critters, a non profit here in Weston CT.  Here is a little bit about Chrstine from her Facebook page:

Christine Peyreigne is a licensed falconer, wildlife rehabilitator for migratory birds and an educator with raptors and reptiles. She rescues injured raptors, rehabilitates and releases those that are able to be released, or finds educational facilities for those deemed non-releasable due to their injuries. Christine's Critters, Inc. is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization.
